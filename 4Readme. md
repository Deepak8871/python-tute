# Assignment 4 – Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
This program reads a text file named `sample.txt` and prints its content line by line.
If the file does not exist, it handles the error gracefully using exception handling.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
This program:
1. Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`
2. Appends additional data to the same file
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file

## Files Included
- task1_read_file.py
- task2_write_append.py
- sample.txt
- output.txt (generated after running Task 2)

## How to Run
```bash
python task1_read_file.py
python task2_write_append.py
